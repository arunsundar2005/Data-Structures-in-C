# Linked List Practice Questions in C

<!-- ## **Basic Questions**
1. Write a program to implement a **singly linked list** and perform the following operations:
   - Insert a node at the beginning.
   - Insert a node at the end.
   - Insert a node at a given position.

2. Write a function to traverse a singly linked list and print its elements.

3. Implement a program to count the number of nodes in a linked list.

4. Write a function to search for an element in a linked list. -->

## **Questions**
1 . Write a program to delete a node:
   - At the beginning.
   - At the end.
   - At a specific position.

2 . Implement a function to reverse a singly linked list.

3 . Write a program to detect and remove a **loop** in a linked list.

4 . Implement a **doubly linked list** with the following operations:
   - Insert a node at the beginning.
   - Delete a node at the end.

9 . Write a function to merge two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted list.

10 . Implement a program to check if a singly linked list is a **palindrome**.


## **Advanced Questions**
11. Write a program to find the **middle element** of a linked list in a single traversal.

12. Implement a function to remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.

13. Write a function to rotate a linked list to the right by `k` positions.

14. Implement a **circular singly linked list** with the following operations:
    - Insert a node at the end.
    - Delete a node at the beginning.
    - Traverse the circular list.

15. Implement a function to split a circular linked list into two halves.

16. Write a program to clone a linked list where each node has a random pointer in addition to the next pointer.

18. Implement a function to sort a linked list using merge sort.

19. Write a function to flatten a multi-level linked list.

20. Implement a program to detect and print the **start of a loop** in a linked list.

21. Design a program to add two numbers represented by two linked lists (each digit is a node).
